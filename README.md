# Micromouse Algorithm

Follow the steps for [Java](https://github.com/mackorone/mms-java) or [Arduino](https://github.com/mackorone/mms-arduino)

Download all the files or clone the repository.

The build command, directory and run command are still the same as mentioned in the pictured examples, you just need to change the directory to where this file is placed and mention the directory where java and javac is present in your machine.

Pressing Build for the first time is compulsory and after that you can just press Run as many times you wish.

Download these [Maps](https://github.com/micromouseonline/mazefiles) for usage. Prefer to use the classic maps, but 32x32 maze does work, just don't use the mazes with less than 16 sides, as mms doesnt register them internally, and are seen as 16x16 mazes and left out boxes as unreachable.
